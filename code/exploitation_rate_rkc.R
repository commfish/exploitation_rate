# redo of a 2013 analysis looking at an "equlibrium" harvest rate (a harvest rate where the overall change in 
#     in the population would be 0).
# This analysis uses southeast alaksa red king crab data. But could be applied to other populations.

# data -----
# Data is sourced from two place.  Annual biomas estimates are from the output of the CSA model for each area
#     in 2017 (stored in excel files for sharability with name of area). Harvest is taken from fish tickets
#     the files here are from the old fish ticket data base (prior to 1985) and the new database.  
#       **FLAG** These values need to be checked with ALEX output to make sure they are pulling the correct harvest

biomass <- read.csv('data/.csv', header = T, check.names = F) # added check.names = F to bring in year as column name without an X in front
