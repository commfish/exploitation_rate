## Introduction
Calculating an appropriate harvest rate for the red king crab fishery in Southeast Alaska is challenging. For many of the survey areas there is not a clear relationship between harvest pressure and population productivity, and furthermore, recruitment, as well as population growth, is highly variable over time. Previous documents have laid out the deficiencies in the Southeast red king crab data and have provided some options for determining harvest rates (Appendices A, B, and C). 

One such option is to calculate equilbrium harvest rates, in 2011 and 2013 attempts to estimate these were performed using a linear regression of the change in population biomass vs the corresponding harvest rate (Appendices A and B). The results of those analyses were viewed as "equilibrium harvest rates".  Opening the commercial fishery in 2017 for the first time since 2011 prompted the need to revisit this analysis (using all years of the data), and to use this relationship to provide an estimate of the risk associated with alternative harvest rates. 
The estimated equlibrium harvest rates should be considered one tool to determine appropriate harvest rates for each portion of the population. Other tools, such as the stock health matrix, should also be considered. Appendix C lists alternative tools that could be explored more in this or future documents. 


##
## Methods 
### Approach 1: Empirical method using CSA biomass estimates
An equilibrium exploitation rate is one that would - on average - result in no net change in population size (i.e. the population growth rate would be 0). In order to estimate this rate the observed harvest rate for a given year is related to the change in estimated biomass between that year and the next using a general linear model:

$HR_{yr}=m(\Delta B_{yr}) + b$

where

$HR_{yr}$ = the observed harvest rate of a given year,  
$\Delta B_{yr}$ = the percentage change in mature biomass from that year to the next year,  
$m$ and $b$= the are parameters to be estimated (slope and intercept, respectively)  

Harvest rates for each year are calculated by dividing the commercial harvest by the mature biomass estimate for a given year:

$HR_{yr}=\frac{C_{yr}}{B_{yr}},$

where

$C_{yr}$ = the observed catch (lbs) in a given year,  
$B_{yr}$ = the estimated mature biomass (lbs) in that year,  

The change in biomass is estimated as:

$\Delta B_{yr} = \frac{(B_{yr+1} - B_{yr})}{B_{yr}}$

The mature male biomass estimates $B$ are from the 2017 CSA analyses (biomass estimates change slightly each year due to the additional data added to the model).  

The equilbrium exploitation rates (percentages) are estimated based on the results of the linear regression analysis. In each area the harvest rate is regressed against the change in mature biomass (using all years that have biomass estimates) to estimate a linear relationship (Eq 1). The equlibrium exploitation rate is estimated from solving for x (harvest rate) where y(change in mature biomass) = 0 in this linear relationship. 

\newline

### Approach 2: Using average harvest and change in biomass
If there is not a signifcant relationship between the two variables in the above regression the average harvest rate and the average biomass change over the entire time period were examined.  Three possibilities arise: 1) if the average change in biomass is positive (the population is growing), then the average harvest rate may by below an equilibrium level, 2) if the average change in biomass is negative (population decline), then the average harvest rate may be above an equilibrium level, or 3) if the average change in biomass is zero, then the harvest rate is approximately at an equlibrium level.  Therefore the sum of the average harvest rate and the average biomass change can be used to predict an appropriate exploitation rate for the survey areas that do not have a statistically significant relationship between harvest rate and change in biomass.

\newline

### Approach 3: Average harvest rate that has sustained the population
An alternative way to examine an appropriate harvest rate for each survey area is to determine the average harvest rate that has produced a sustainable population.  For the sack of this analysis sustainable is defined as a harvest rate that has resulting in an increase in the population size. Using the figures from approach 1 this is the average harvest rate of those point above the y (change in biomass) = 0 line.

####Terms:

**Exploitation rate** (er): the percentage of the estimated biomass that is available for harvest

**Harvest rate** (hr): the observed fraction of the estimated biomass that is caught in the commercial fishery.  

**Equilibrium exploitation rate** or percentage (equ.er): an exploitation percentage that results in an equilibrium population size or a change of 0 in population size over time.  

**Adjusted equilibrium exploitation rate** or percentage (equ.er.adj): equilibrium exploitation rate calculated from mark-recapture adjusted biomass estimates. 

\newline


## Results

### Equilibrium exploitation rate (equER) - linear regression approach
#### Table 1: Equlibrium exploitation rate using mark-recapture adjusted mature biomass (show as proportions)
```{r eqhrate, echo = FALSE }
equ_hr <- read.csv("../results/equ_harvest_rate.csv")
equ_hr %>% 
  select(area, avg.hr, avg.pop.change, p.value, r.squared, equ.er.adj) %>% 
  #mutate(avg.hr = avg.hr*100, avg.pop.change = avg.pop.change*100, 
   #      equ.er.adj = equ.er.adj*100) %>% 
  kable(digits = 3)
```

*juneau does not have an adjusted biomass

Average equlibrium exploitation rate for all areas (unweighted and weighted by average mature biomass over the entire time series) is: 
```{r hravg_all, echo = FALSE}
equ_hr %>% 
  summarise(unweighted = mean(equ.er.adj), weighted = weighted.mean(equ.er.adj, mature.lb.avg))

```



### Harvest rate - average approach 
Table 2 summarises both the equlibrium exploitation rate calculated in approach 1 (equ.er.adj), the equilibrium exploitation rate calculated using averages over the entire time serires (alt.equ.hr), and the average harvest rate during years with a positive change in the population (avg.inc.hr). For some areas (Peril, Lynn Sisters, Gambier, and Juneau) the two values for an estimate of equlibrium harvest rate are the same or very similar (within one percent). For other areas there is a larger difference. Pybus, Seymour, and Excursion have average equlibrium exploitation rates that are approximately double those calculated with approach 1. 
With these two alternative approaches there is not an easy method to quantify risk of alternative harvest rates on the population.


#### Table 2: Exploitation rate using the average approach
```{r avghrate, echo = FALSE }
avg_hr <- read.csv("../results/table3.csv")
avg_hr %>% 
  dplyr::select(-X, -p.value, -r.squared, - mature.lb.avg) ->avg_hr
avg_hr %>% 
  dplyr::select(area, avg.hr, avg.pop.change, alt.equ.hr, equ.er.adj, avg.inc.hr) %>%
  mutate(avg.hr = avg.hr*100, avg.pop.change = avg.pop.change*100, 
         alt.equ.hr = alt.equ.hr*100,equ.er.adj = equ.er.adj*100, 
         avg.inc.hr = avg.inc.hr*100) %>% 
  kable(digits = 1)
```

### Risk assessment 

During the discussion of opening the 2017 fishery there was a request to help assess the risk of fishing at a range of harvest rates (instead of just looking at the equilibrium harvest rate). Assessing risk is complex because the linear relationship examined in approach 1 has alot of variablity about it in most areas. However, a rough estimate of risk - in terms of the percentage of mature population decline - can be estimated from these relationships from each area's linear regression model. Three scenarios are presented here:

##### 1) Decline in the mature male biomass of 5%. 
This is the estimated exploitation rate (risk.5pct) that may result in a 5% decline in the mature male biomass in the following year.


##### 2) Decline in the mature male biomass of 10%.
This is the estimated exploitation rate (risk.10pct) that may result in a 10% decline in the mature male biomass in the following year.


##### 3) Impact of a 20% harvest rate on the mature male biomass. 
This is the estimated decline in mature male biomass (change.20pct.HR) in the next year that would result from a 20% harvest rate (historically the maximum harvest rate we've imposed on Southeast red crab populations) on mature male biomass. 


#### Table 3: Assessing risk in equlibrium harvest rates
```{r risk, echo = FALSE }
risk <- read.csv("../results/risk_using_equhr.csv")
kable(risk[, 2:7], digits = 2)
```

#### Figures : Area specific regression relationships
The following figures display the area specific regressions of observed harvest rate and change in mature biomass.  For all survey areas, except Juneau, the mature biomass used is the adjusted marture biomass using the mark-recapture survey results to adjust the CSA estimates.
Three reference point are presented in each figure.  The solid black line is the equlibrium exploitation rate from the regression analysis. The dashed purple line is the alternative equlibrium harvest rate calculated using approach 2 above. The dark grey dotted line is the average harvest rate in years with increases in mature biomass.
