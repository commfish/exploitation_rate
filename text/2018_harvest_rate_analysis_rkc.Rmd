## Introduction
Determing an appropriate harvest rate for the red king crab fishery in Southeast Alaska has been challenging. There is not a clear relationship between harvest pressure and population productivity for most areas, and furthermore, recruitment, as well as population growth, is highly variable over time. In 2011 and 2013 attempts to estimate equilibrium harvest rate were performed using a linear regression method of the change in population biomass vs the corresponding harvest rate. The results of those analyses were have been seen as "equilibrium harvest rates".  Opening the commercial fishery in 2017 for the first time since 2011 prompted the idea to revisit this analysis (using all data), and to also determine if this relationship can be used to provide alternative harvest rates and the risk associated with them.


## Methods 
### Approach 1: Empirical method using CSA biomass estimates
To estimate an appropriate exploitation rate where the crab biomass does not change in the following year (i.e., where population growth rate is zero), the observed harvest rate of a given year is related to the change in estimated biomass between that year and the next using a general linear model:

$HR_{yr}=m(\Delta B_{yr}) + b$

where

$HR_{yr}$ = the observed harvest rate of a given year,  
$\Delta B$ = the percentage change in mature biomass from that year to the next year,  
$m$ and $b$= the are parameters to be estimated (slope and intercept, respectively)  

Harvest rates for each year are calculated by dividing the commercial harvest by the mature biomass estimate for a given year:

$HR_{yr}=\frac{C_{yr}}{B_{yr}},$

where

$C_{yr}$ = the observed harvest rate of a given year,  
$B_{yr}$ = the estimated mature biomass in that year,  

The change in biomass is estimated as:

$\Delta B_{yr} = \frac{(B_{yr+1} - B_{yr})}{B_{yr}}$

The mature male biomass estimates $B$ are from the 2017 CSA analyses (biomass estimates change slightly each year due to the additional data added to the model).  

The equilbrium exploitation rates (or percentages) are estimated based on the results of the linear regression analysis. In each area, for every year we have biomass estimates, the harvest rate is regressed against the change in mature biomass to estimate a linear relationship (Eq 1). The equlibrium exploitation rate is estimated from solving for where y(change in mature biomass) = 0 in this linear relationship. 




### Approach 2: Using average harvest and change in biomass
If, however no relationship exists between the two variables, the average harvest rate and the average biomass change were examined.  Three possibilities arise: 1) if the average change in biomass is positive (the population is growing), then the average harvest rate is too low, 2) if the average change in biomass is negative (population decline), then the average harvest rate is too high, or 3) if the average change in biomass is zero, then the harvest rate is correct.  Therefore the sum of the average harvest rate and the average biomass change is used to predict an appropriate exploitation rate for the survey areas that do not have a statistically significant relationship between harvest rate and change in biomass.



Defintions:
**Exploitation rate** (ER): the percentage of the estimated biomass that is available for harvest
**Harvest rate** (HR): the observed fraction of the estimated biomass that is caught in the commercial fishery.  
**Equilibrium exploitation rate** or percentage (ERequ): an exploitation percentage that results in an equilibrium population size or a change of 0 in population size over time.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
