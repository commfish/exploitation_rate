## Introduction
Determing an appropriate harvest rate for the red king crab fishery in Southeast Alaska has been challenging. There is not a clear relationship between harvest pressure and population productivity for most areas, and furthermore, recruitment, as well as population growth, is highly variable over time. In 2011 and 2013 attempts to estimate equilibrium harvest rate were performed using a linear regression method of the change in population biomass vs the corresponding harvest rate. The results of those analyses were viewed as "equilibrium harvest rates".  Opening the commercial fishery in 2017 for the first time since 2011 prompted the idea to revisit this analysis (using all data), and to also determine if this relationship can be used to provide alternative harvest rates and the risk associated with them.


## Methods 
### Approach 1: Empirical method using CSA biomass estimates
To estimate an appropriate exploitation rate where the crab biomass does not change in the following year (i.e., where population growth rate is zero), the observed harvest rate of a given year is related to the change in estimated biomass between that year and the next using a general linear model:

$HR_{yr}=m(\Delta B_{yr}) + b$

where

$HR_{yr}$ = the observed harvest rate of a given year,  
$\Delta B_{yr}$ = the percentage change in mature biomass from that year to the next year,  
$m$ and $b$= the are parameters to be estimated (slope and intercept, respectively)  

Harvest rates for each year are calculated by dividing the commercial harvest by the mature biomass estimate for a given year:

$HR_{yr}=\frac{C_{yr}}{B_{yr}},$

where

$C_{yr}$ = the observed catch (lbs) in a given year,  
$B_{yr}$ = the estimated mature biomass (lbs) in that year,  

The change in biomass is estimated as:

$\Delta B_{yr} = \frac{(B_{yr+1} - B_{yr})}{B_{yr}}$

The mature male biomass estimates $B$ are from the 2017 CSA analyses (biomass estimates change slightly each year due to the additional data added to the model).  

The equilbrium exploitation rates (percentages) are estimated based on the results of the linear regression analysis. In each area the harvest rate is regressed against the change in mature biomass (using all years that have biomass estimates) to estimate a linear relationship (Eq 1). The equlibrium exploitation rate is estimated from solving for x (harvest rate) where y(change in mature biomass) = 0 in this linear relationship. 




### Approach 2: Using average harvest and change in biomass
If there is not a signifcant relationship between the two variables in the above regression than the average harvest rate and the average biomass change were examined.  Three possibilities arise: 1) if the average change in biomass is positive (the population is growing), then the average harvest rate may by too low, 2) if the average change in biomass is negative (population decline), then the average harvest rate may be too high, or 3) if the average change in biomass is zero, then the harvest rate is correct.  Therefore the sum of the average harvest rate and the average biomass change is used to predict an appropriate exploitation rate for the survey areas that do not have a statistically significant relationship between harvest rate and change in biomass.



Defintions:

**Exploitation rate** (ER): the percentage of the estimated biomass that is available for harvest

**Harvest rate** (HR): the observed fraction of the estimated biomass that is caught in the commercial fishery.  

**Equilibrium exploitation rate** or percentage (equER): an exploitation percentage that results in an equilibrium population size or a change of 0 in population size over time.  




## Results

### Equilibrium exploitation rate (equER) - linear regression approach
#### Table 1: Equlibrium exploitation rate using mark-recapture adjusted mature biomass
```{r eqhrate, echo = FALSE }
equ_hr <- read.csv("../results/equ_harvest_rate.csv")
kable(equ_hr[ ,2:7], digits = 3)
```

*juneau does not have an adjusted biomass

Average equlibrium exploitation rate for all areas (unweighted) is: 
```{r hravg_all, echo = FALSE}
equ_hr %>% 
  summarize(mean(equ.hr.adj))
```

### Harvest rate - average approach 
Table 2 summarises both the equlibrium exploitation rate calculated in approach 1 (equ.hr.adj) and the equilibrium exploitation rate calculated using averages over the entire time serires (alt.equ.hr). For some areas (Peril, Lynn Sisters, Gambier, and Juneau) these two values are the same or very similar (within one percent). For other areas there is a larger difference. Pybus, Seymour, and Excursion have average equlibrium exploitation rates that are approximately double those calculated with approach 1. 
With this approach there is not an easy method to quantify risk of alternative harvest rates on the population.


#### Table 2: Exploitation rate using the average approach
```{r avghrate, echo = FALSE }
avg_hr <- read.csv("../results/equ_harvest_rate_alt.csv")
avg_hr %>% 
  dplyr::select(-X, -p.value, -r.squared) ->avg_hr
kable(avg_hr, digits = 3)
```



### Risk assessment 
During the discussion of opening the 2017 fishery there was a request to help assess the risk of fishing at a range of harvest rates (instead of just looking at the equilibrium harvest rate). Assessing risk is complex because the linear relationship examined in approach 1 has alot of variablity about it in most areas. However, a rough estimate of risk - in terms of the percentage of mature population decline - can be estimated from these relationships from each area's linear regression model. Three scenarios are presented here:

##### 1) Decline in the mature male biomass of 5%. 
This is the estimated exploitation rate (risk.5pct) that may result in a 5% decline in the mature male biomass in the following year.
##### 2) Decline in the mature male biomass of 10%.
This is the estimated exploitation rate (risk.10pct) that may result in a 10% decline in the mature male biomass in the following year.
##### 3) Impact of a 20% harvest rate on the mature male biomass. 
This is the estimated decline in mature male biomass (change.20pct.HR) in the next year that would result from a 20% harvest rate on mature male biomass. 


#### Table 3: Assessing risk in equlibrium harvest rates
```{r risk, echo = FALSE }
risk <- read.csv("../results/risk_using_equhr.csv")
kable(risk[, 2:7], digits = 2)
